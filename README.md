[simple_calendar](https://github.com/excid3/simple_calendar) is a
Rubygem for generating calendars with Rails.

This example shows you how to override the default calendar links to
use AJAX when you change calendar views.

Take a look at [bd67d655866cb9da1bd061df4146f0fd44b5be96](https://github.com/excid3/simple_calendar-ajax-example/commit/bd67d655866cb9da1bd061df4146f0fd44b5be96) for the exact steps needed to setup remote links for simple_calendar.
